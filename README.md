# Sample React Blog

This is a sample blog I used to get started with ReactJS. 
It shows how to simply use the state, how to fork with forms and really basics ReactJS features.

To view the end result visit https://cristytarantino.github.io/reactjs-blog.

N.B. The project is full of comments for my personal learning experience.


# Getting started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

To get started simply run `yarn install` or `npm install`.

Once the installation process is done just run `yarn start` or `npm start`.
